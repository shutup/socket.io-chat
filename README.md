##What is this?
this is an android app that can chat with somebody through socket.io . 
And i am not good at js,so the server is as simple as possiable.

##How to use it?
* run client
  * setup android studio 
  * git clone the code to your computer,and use android studio to import .
    fix any environment issues then it should work.
* run server
  * setup node.js
  * the default server is 
    in my vps.and the server is not always online.So the perfect way is to
    setup your own server.the demo server code is also provided.
